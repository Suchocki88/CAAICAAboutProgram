                    <p>This course represents a fundamentally different approach to teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence. Rather than targeting computer science or advanced math students, <strong>Understanding AI</strong> brings these critical concepts to social science students through hands-on experimentation, creative application, and critical analysis of AI's societal impact.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Your students won't write code or solve complex equations. Instead, they'll become AI researchers‚Äîconducting systematic experiments, documenting observations, and developing the literacy skills needed to navigate an AI-shaped world.</p>

                <h2>Flexibility and Pacing: You Have Breathing Room</h2>
                
                <div class="flex-box">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2e7d32;">Built-In Flex Days</h3>
                    <p>This program is designed as a <strong>70-lesson curriculum with approximately 18 flex days built into the semester</strong>. This flexibility is intentional and essential.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What Are Flex Days?</h4>
                    <p>Flex days are unscheduled days you can use for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extending lessons:</strong> If a lab day generates rich discussion, continue it the next day</li>
                        <li><strong>Deepening learning:</strong> When students need more time with complex concepts</li>
                        <li><strong>Catching up:</strong> After absences, technical issues, or school closures</li>
                        <li><strong>Project work:</strong> Additional time for creative writing collaboration</li>
                        <li><strong>Review:</strong> Before chapter assessments</li>
                        <li><strong>Student-driven exploration:</strong> Following unexpected interesting questions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Permission to Adjust Pacing</h4>
                    <p><strong>Quality of learning matters more than speed through curriculum.</strong> If Lesson 2.6 needs two class periods instead of one, take two periods. Use your flex days. That's what they're for.</p>

                    <h4>When to Use Flex Days</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> If Alia access is interrupted, don't skip the lab‚Äîdelay and use a flex day</li>
                        <li><strong>Rich discussion emerges:</strong> Students are making connections? Extend the discussion day</li>
                        <li><strong>Complexity appears:</strong> Some concepts (like training data or bias) may need extra processing time</li>
                        <li><strong>Assessment prep:</strong> Chapter exams are conceptually challenging‚Äîallow review time</li>
                        <li><strong>Student request:</strong> "Can we have another day to work on our projects?" Yes, if you have flex days</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Tracking Your Flex Days</h4>
                    <p>Keep a simple log: <em>"Used 1 flex day after Lesson 2.3 for extended discussion. Used 2 flex days for Chapter 2 exam review. 15 flex days remaining."</em></p>
                    <p>This helps you gauge pacing and ensures you're using the flexibility intentionally.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #01579b;">About Time Estimates</h3>
                    <p><strong>Time estimates in lesson materials are approximations to help with planning‚Äînot rigid requirements.</strong></p>
                    
                    <h4>In Student-Facing Materials:</h4>
                    <p>You'll notice student lessons generally do not include specific time allocations (like "5 minutes" or "20 minutes"). This is intentional. Different classes move at different paces, and we want to avoid creating artificial pressure to "finish on time."</p>
                    <p><strong>Communicate timing verbally</strong> or write it on the board based on your class's needs and your professional judgment.</p>

                    <h4>In Teacher Guides:</h4>
                    <p>Teacher guides DO include suggested time allocations to help you plan your period. However, please note:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These estimates are generated by AI without direct classroom experience</li>
                        <li>They're educated guesses, not empirically tested timings</li>
                        <li>Your class may need more or less time based on:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Student engagement level</li>
                                <li>Depth of discussion that emerges</li>
                                <li>Technical issues</li>
                                <li>Prior knowledge and experience</li>
                                <li>Class size and dynamics</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Your Professional Judgment Matters Most</h4>
                    <p><strong>Trust yourself.</strong> If an activity is generating valuable learning but taking longer than estimated, continue it. If students grasp a concept quickly, move forward. The estimates are guides, not mandates.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You have flex days built into the semester specifically for when lessons need more time. Use them without guilt. Quality learning is the goal, not speed through materials.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #6a1b9a;">Platform Editing Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>The PocketLab Notebook platform gives you <strong>full editing control</strong> over every lesson before you assign it to students. You're not locked into a rigid curriculum‚Äîyou can customize content to match your teaching style, your students' needs, and your classroom context.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What You Can Edit:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Remove sections:</strong> If a section doesn't fit your class, delete it</li>
                        <li><strong>Add content:</strong> Insert additional examples, local connections, or relevant current events</li>
                        <li><strong>Edit text:</strong> Rewrite paragraphs to match your voice or simplify/complexify language</li>
                        <li><strong>Add or remove questions:</strong> Adjust the number and type of questions in Chapter Assignments</li>
                        <li><strong>Reorder activities:</strong> Change the sequence to better fit your pedagogical approach</li>
                        <li><strong>Modify instructions:</strong> Clarify, expand, or simplify directions as needed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Create Multiple Versions</h4>
                    <p>You can create and save different versions of lessons for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Different class levels:</strong> Honors section gets extensions; standard section gets more scaffolding</li>
                        <li><strong>Different student needs:</strong> Create modified versions for IEP/504 accommodations</li>
                        <li><strong>Different pacing:</strong> Year 1 version vs. refined Year 2 version based on what you learned</li>
                        <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Try different approaches and see what works best</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Base Version Always Available</h4>
                    <p>No matter how much you customize, you'll always have access to the original base version of each lesson. This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can start over if an edit doesn't work out</li>
                        <li>You can compare your version to the original</li>
                        <li>You can selectively adopt updates when the base program is revised</li>
                        <li>New teachers can start with the base version and customize gradually</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Connection to Grading</h4>
                    <p>Because you can add or remove questions from Chapter Assignments, the total point values will vary based on your customization. Remember:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perfect score = (Number of questions) √ó 3</li>
                        <li>Communicate your point threshold to students at the start of each chapter</li>
                        <li>Your customization = your grading structure</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="philosophy-box">
                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                    <p><strong>You know your students.</strong> A lesson that works perfectly for one class might need adjustment for another. An example that resonates in one community might fall flat in another. A pacing that's right in October might be too fast in January.</p>
                    
                    <p>This platform treats you as the professional you are‚Äîcapable of making informed decisions about what your students need. Use that capability.</p>

                    <h4>Common Customizations Teachers Make:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adding local connections:</strong> "Here's how AI is used in our city's traffic management..."</li>
                        <li><strong>Updating examples:</strong> Replace outdated references with current ones</li>
                        <li><strong>Differentiating for ESL students:</strong> Add vocabulary support, simplify instructions</li>
                        <li><strong>Extending for advanced students:</strong> Add research tasks, deeper analysis questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Streamlining for time:</strong> Remove optional activities when schedule is tight</li>
                        <li><strong>Adding scaffolding:</strong> Insert sentence frames, graphic organizers, step-by-step guides</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>First time teaching this course?</strong> Consider using the base version for Chapter 1, then customize Chapters 2-8 based on what you learn about your students. You don't need to customize everything immediately.

                <h2>Course Philosophy</h2>

                <h3>Why Social Sciences?</h3>
                <div class="philosophy-box">
                    <p>Social science students are uniquely positioned to understand AI's most important dimensions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ethical implications</strong> of algorithmic decision-making</li>
                        <li><strong>Social impact</strong> of AI systems on communities and democracy</li>
                        <li><strong>Bias and fairness</strong> in machine learning applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Human behavior</strong> in relationship to AI technology</li>
                        <li><strong>Policy questions</strong> surrounding AI regulation and governance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">These students may not become AI engineers, but they'll become the citizens, policymakers, journalists, educators, counselors, and community leaders who shape how AI is developed, deployed, and regulated. They need AI literacy as urgently as any computer science major‚Äîperhaps more so.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The "Alia" Approach</h3>
                <p>Throughout this course, students work with <strong>Alia</strong>‚Äîthe name for our AI system customized to provide a directed and safe AI experience. Why give it a name?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Demystification:</strong> A named entity feels less intimidating than "artificial intelligence system"</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship building:</strong> Students develop a working partnership with their AI lab partner</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The same system throughout ensures reliable progression of understanding</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal connection:</strong> Just as students might name a class pet, Alia becomes familiar</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Students don't just chat with AI‚Äîthey conduct structured experiments, test hypotheses, and document findings scientifically. This transforms passive consumption into active investigation.</p>

                <h2>The Field Journal: Heart of Scientific Learning</h2>

                <h3>What is the Field Journal?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Field Journal</strong> is where students document every lab experiment throughout the semester. Think of it as a scientist's lab notebook‚Äîa systematic record of hypotheses, observations, analyses, and insights.</p>

                <h3>Why Field Journals Matter</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>For students:</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Creates study resource for assessments</li>
                        <li>Builds habit of reflective practice</li>
                        <li>Demonstrates learning progression over time</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Provides ongoing formative assessment data</li>
                        <li>Reveals student thinking and misconceptions</li>
                        <li>Documents student growth across semester</li>
                        <li>Offers alternative assessment for diverse learners</li>

                <h3>Field Journal Structure</h3>
                <p>Each lab day includes a structured journal entry with scaffolded prompts. The scaffolding gradually releases over the semester:</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Throughout the semester, students develop a creative writing project in collaboration with Alia using a <strong>developmental editor/ghost writer model</strong>. Students act as editors directing AI as their ghost writer‚Äîlearning editorial judgment and AI direction rather than traditional writing skills.</p>

                <div class="philosophy-box">
                    <h4>What's a Ghost Writer?</h4>
                    <p>In professional publishing, a ghost writer writes content based on someone else's ideas. Many "authored by" books are ghost-written‚Äîthe credited person provides vision and direction, the ghost writer produces prose.</p>
                    <p><strong>Student role:</strong> Developmental editor (provides vision, makes creative decisions)<br>
                    <strong>Alia role:</strong> Ghost writer (generates prose based on student direction)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Hybrid Approach</h3>
                <p>Students can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct Alia to generate prose scenes</li>
                    <li>Write some prose themselves</li>
                    <li>Mix AI-generated and self-written content</li>
                    <li>Maintain editorial control throughout</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Project Days (8 total across semester)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 1</strong> (Lesson 1.6): Launch project, establish editor/writer model</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 2</strong> (Lesson 2.6): Build core elements, generate prose scenes</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Days 3-7:</strong> Continue development using various AI literacy skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 8</strong> (Lessons 8.3 & 8.7): Final compilation and reflection</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="note-box">
                    Students are assessed on <strong>editorial judgment and AI collaboration skills</strong>, not literary quality. The focus is on how well they direct AI, evaluate output, and maintain creative vision‚Äînot on writing talent.

                <h3>Component 1: Chapter Assignments (20%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>What Is the Chapter Assignment?</h4>
                    <p>A Chapter Assignment consists of questions embedded within lessons that students answer as they engage with content. These assess comprehension and engagement.</p>

                    <h4>The 4-Point Rubric System</h4>
                    <p>Teachers grade each question using a simple 4-point scale:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1 = Needs Work:</strong> Answer shows minimal understanding or effort</li>
                        <li><strong>2 = Making Progress:</strong> Answer shows partial understanding with gaps</li>
                        <li><strong>3 = You Got It:</strong> Answer demonstrates solid understanding (this is the target/perfect score)</li>
                        <li><strong>4 = Above and Beyond:</strong> Answer shows exceptional insight or connections beyond expectations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="note-box">
                        A score of <strong>3 ("You Got It")</strong> is considered perfect/100%. Students who earn a 3 on every question have fully mastered the material. A score of 4 is reserved for truly exceptional work that goes beyond what was asked.
                    </div>

                    <h4>Point Threshold for 100%</h4>
                    <p>The point threshold for earning 100% on a Chapter Assignment = <strong>Number of Questions √ó 3</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Chapter 2 has 40 questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perfect score (100%) = 40 questions √ó 3 = 120 points</li>
                        <li>Student who earns all 3s = 120 points = 100%</li>
                        <li>Student who earns mix of 3s and 4s = more than 120 points = 100% or extra credit at your discretion</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>There Are 8 Chapter Assignments</h4>
                    <p>Since there are 8 chapters in the course, students complete 8 Chapter Assignments over the semester.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 2: Chapter Exams (40%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Chapter Exams are formal assessments given at the end of every other chapter (4 exams total). These assess deeper understanding, application, and synthesis of concepts.</p>
                    <p>We recommend <strong>each exam counts equally</strong> toward the 40% total for this component.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 3: Class Participation (10%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Class Participation includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active engagement during Lesson Days and Discussion Days</li>
                        <li>Quality of contributions to class dialogue</li>
                        <li>Collaborative work during group activities</li>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Field Journal entries document all lab experiments. Graded on completeness, specificity, and thoughtfulness‚Äînot "right answers."</p>

                <h2>Common Teacher Questions</h2>

                <h3>"I'm not a computer science teacher. Can I really teach this?"</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> This course is designed for social science teachers, not CS teachers. You don't need to understand how neural networks work at a technical level‚Äîyou need to facilitate student discovery of how AI behaves and impacts society.</p>

                <h3>"What if lessons take longer than expected?"</h3>
                <p><strong>Use your flex days.</strong> You have approximately 18 flex days built into the semester specifically for this purpose. Quality of learning matters more than speed through materials.</p>

                <h3>"How accurate are the time estimates?"</h3>
                <p><strong>They're educated guesses.</strong> Time estimates in teacher guides are AI-generated approximations without direct classroom testing. Adjust based on your class's needs. Your professional judgment supersedes any estimate.</p>

                <h3>"What if students ask technical questions I can't answer?"</h3>
                <p>This is an opportunity, not a problem. Respond with: "That's a great question. Let's design an experiment to investigate it." You're teaching scientific thinking, not memorized facts.</p>

                <h3>"How much time does grading field journals take?"</h3>
                <p>With practice, expect 15-20 minutes per set of 25 journals using the rubric approach. That's roughly 30-40 seconds per entry.</p>

                <h3>"What if my school blocks Alia?"</h3>
                <p>Work with your IT department <strong>before the course starts</strong> to whitelist PocketLab.net. Explain this is an educational AI literacy course, not recreational AI use.</p>

                <h2>Your Role as Facilitator</h2>

                <h3>What This Course Asks of You</h3>
                <p><strong>You are a guide, not a sage.</strong> Your job isn't to have all the answers about AI‚Äîit's to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Facilitate student discovery</strong> through structured experiments</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask probing questions</strong> that deepen thinking</li>
                    <li><strong>Create safe space</strong> for intellectual risk-taking</li>
