                    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; border: none; color: #1976d2;">Welcome to Understanding AI</h2>
                    <p>This course represents a fundamentally different approach to teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence. Rather than targeting computer science or advanced math students, <strong>Understanding AI</strong> brings these critical concepts to social science students through hands-on experimentation, creative application, and critical analysis of AI's societal impact.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Your students won't write code or solve complex equations. Instead, they'll become AI researchers‚Äîconducting systematic experiments, documenting observations, and developing the literacy skills needed to navigate an AI-shaped world.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Course Philosophy</h2>

                <h3>Why Social Sciences?</h3>
                <div class="philosophy-box">
                    <p>Social science students are uniquely positioned to understand AI's most important dimensions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ethical implications</strong> of algorithmic decision-making</li>
                        <li><strong>Social impact</strong> of AI systems on communities and democracy</li>
                        <li><strong>Bias and fairness</strong> in machine learning applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Human behavior</strong> in relationship to AI technology</li>
                        <li><strong>Policy questions</strong> surrounding AI regulation and governance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">These students may not become AI engineers, but they'll become the citizens, policymakers, journalists, educators, counselors, and community leaders who shape how AI is developed, deployed, and regulated. They need AI literacy as urgently as any computer science major‚Äîperhaps more so.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The "Alia" Approach</h3>
                <p>Throughout this course, students work with <strong>Alia</strong>‚Äîthe name for our AI system customized to provide a directed and safe AI experience. Why give it a name?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Demystification:</strong> A named entity feels less intimidating than "artificial intelligence system"</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship building:</strong> Students develop a working partnership with their AI lab partner</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The same system throughout ensures reliable progression of understanding</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal connection:</strong> Just as students might name a class pet, Alia becomes familiar</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Students don't just chat with AI‚Äîthey conduct structured experiments, test hypotheses, and document findings scientifically. This transforms passive consumption into active investigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Course Structure Overview</h2>

                <h2>The Field Journal: Heart of Scientific Learning</h2>

                <h3>What is the Field Journal?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Field Journal</strong> is where students document every lab experiment throughout the semester. Think of it as a scientist's lab notebook‚Äîa systematic record of hypotheses, observations, analyses, and insights.</p>

                <h3>Why Field Journals Matter</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>For students:</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Provides ongoing formative assessment data</li>
                        <li>Reveals student thinking and misconceptions</li>
                        <li>Documents student growth across semester</li>
                        <li>Offers alternative assessment for diverse learners</li>
                        <li>Creates accountability for lab engagement</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Field Journal Structure</h3>
                <p>Each lab day includes a structured journal entry with scaffolded prompts. The scaffolding gradually releases over the semester:</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Throughout the semester, students develop a creative writing project (short story, narrative, or creative piece) in collaboration with Alia. This isn't "AI writes your story"‚Äîit's learning to use AI as a thinking partner while maintaining human creative control.</p>

                <h3>Project Days (8 total across semester)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 1</strong> (Lesson 1.6): Story planning and AI brainstorming</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 2</strong> (Lesson 2.9): Character development with AI collaboration</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 3</strong> (Lesson 2.10): Pattern recognition in story structures</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 4</strong> (Lesson 3.9): Plot development using prompt engineering</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 5</strong> (Lesson 4.8): Using AI prediction for narrative choices</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 6</strong> (Lesson 5.7): Analyzing bias in creative AI suggestions</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 7</strong> (Lesson 7.7): Distinguishing authentic vs. AI content</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Day 8</strong> (Lesson 8.3 & 8.7): Final compilation and reflection</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Creative Writing?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Accessible to all students</strong> regardless of technical background</li>
                    <li><strong>Personally meaningful</strong> - students create something uniquely theirs</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrates AI collaboration skills</strong> in low-stakes environment</li>
                    <li><strong>Reveals AI capabilities and limitations</strong> through creative constraints</li>
                    <li><strong>Builds portfolio</strong> students can share beyond the course</li>
                    <li><strong>Engages different learning styles</strong> than traditional academic work</li>

                    </table>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 1: Chapter Assignments (20%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>What Are Chapter Assignments?</h4>
                    <p>Chapter Assignments consist of questions embedded within the core lessons that students answer as they read or watch lesson content. These questions assess comprehension and engagement with the material.</p>

                    <h4>The 4-Point Rubric System</h4>
                    <p>Teachers grade each question using a simple 4-point scale:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1 = Needs Work:</strong> Answer shows minimal understanding or effort</li>
                        <li><strong>2 = Making Progress:</strong> Answer shows partial understanding with gaps</li>
                        <li><strong>3 = You Got It:</strong> Answer demonstrates solid understanding (this is the target/perfect score)</li>
                        <li><strong>4 = Above and Beyond:</strong> Answer shows exceptional insight or connections beyond expectations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="note-box">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> A score of <strong>3 ("You Got It")</strong> is considered perfect/100%. Students who earn a 3 on every question have fully mastered the material. A score of 4 is reserved for truly exceptional work that goes beyond what was asked.
                    </div>

                    <h4>Point Threshold for 100%</h4>
                    <p>The point threshold for earning 100% on a Chapter Assignment = <strong>Number of Questions √ó 3</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Chapter 2 has 15 questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perfect score (100%) = 15 questions √ó 3 = 45 points</li>
                        <li>Student who earns all 3s = 45 points = 100%</li>
                        <li>Student who earns mix of 3s and 4s = more than 45 points = over 100% (extra credit)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Flexibility for Teachers</h4>
                    <p>The platform allows teachers to customize their course by adding or removing questions from lessons as they see fit. Because of this flexibility, the exact number of questions per chapter may vary. Teachers should:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Determine final question count for each chapter based on their customization</li>
                        <li>Calculate point threshold: (Number of Questions √ó 3)</li>
                        <li>Communicate this threshold to students at the start of each chapter</li>
                        <li>Grade using the 1-4 rubric described above</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>There Are 8 Chapter Assignments</h4>
                    <p>Since there are 8 chapters in the course, students complete 8 Chapter Assignments over the semester. Each Chapter Assignment counts equally toward the 20% total for this component.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 2: Chapter Exams (40%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Chapter Exams are formal assessments given at the end of each chapter (8 exams total). These exams assess deeper understanding, application, and synthesis of chapter concepts. Format may include multiple choice, short answer, scenario analysis, and performance tasks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Each exam counts equally</strong> toward the 40% total for this component.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 3: Class Participation (10%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Class Participation includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active engagement during Lesson Days and Discussion Days</li>
                        <li>Quality of contributions to class dialogue</li>
                        <li>Collaborative work during group activities</li>
                        <li>Professional conduct during Lab Days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Teachers should track participation throughout each chapter and assign grades at natural checkpoints (e.g., end of chapter, mid-semester, end of semester).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 4: Field Journal (15%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Field Journal entries document all lab experiments throughout the semester. Students complete approximately 25-28 journal entries total across all lab days.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Grading Field Journal Entries:</strong></p>
                    <p>Field journals are <strong>NOT graded on "right answers"</strong>‚Äîthey're graded on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Completeness (40%):</strong> All sections attempted, evidence of effort</li>
                        <li><strong>Specificity (30%):</strong> Concrete examples from experiments, detailed observations</li>
                        <li><strong>Thoughtfulness (30%):</strong> Critical thinking, connections to concepts, insightful analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Suggested approach:</strong> Use a simple 3-point scale for each criterion (3 = Exceeds, 2 = Meets, 1 = Needs improvement). Total: 9 possible points per entry. Convert to percentage: (points earned / 9) √ó 100.</p>

                    <p>See the Field Journal section elsewhere in this guide for detailed grading information and scaffolding progression.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Component 5: Creative Writing Project (15%)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>The Creative Writing Project is a semester-long portfolio developed through 8 Project Days across the course. Students are assessed on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quality of AI collaboration</strong> (not literary quality)</li>

                <h2>Common Teacher Questions</h2>

                <h3>"I'm not a computer science teacher. Can I really teach this?"</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> This course is designed for social science teachers, not CS teachers. You don't need to understand how neural networks work at a technical level‚Äîyou need to facilitate student discovery of how AI behaves and impacts society. If you can moderate a discussion and guide student inquiry, you can teach this course.</p>
                <p>The teacher's guides provide all technical background you need. You're learning alongside your students, which models lifelong learning perfectly.</p>

                <h3>"What if students ask technical questions I can't answer?"</h3>
                <p>This is an opportunity, not a problem. Respond with: "That's a great question. Let's design an experiment to investigate it." Or: "I don't know‚Äîlet's research that together."</p>
                <p>You're teaching scientific thinking, not memorized facts. "I don't know, let's find out" is a perfectly appropriate teacher response in this course.</p>

                <h3>"How much time does grading field journals take?"</h3>
                <p>With practice, expect 15-20 minutes per set of 25 journals using the rubric approach. That's roughly 30-40 seconds per entry. You're not reading every word‚Äîyou're scanning for completion, specificity, and thoughtfulness.</p>
                <p>Many teachers grade journals during students' independent project work time or as students complete chapter assessments.</p>

                <h3>"What if a student uses AI to write their field journal?"</h3>
                <p>This would be immediately obvious‚Äîfield journals document specific experiments each student conducted. AI can't accurately describe what Alia said to THIS student during THIS experiment.</p>
                <p>If you suspect AI-generated journal entries, conference with the student: "Walk me through what happened when you asked Alia [specific question from their experiment]." Authentic entries will include specific details; AI-generated entries will be generic.</p>

                <h3>"What about students who don't have home internet access?"</h3>
                <p>All work can be completed during class time. Project days and lab days don't require homework. If students want to work outside class, provide time during school (study hall, library, before/after school) when possible.</p>

                <h3>"How do I handle inappropriate AI interactions?"</h3>
                <p>Set clear expectations in Week 1: "Alia is our class learning tool, like a textbook. Treat it professionally."</p>
                <p>Claude.ai has built-in safety features and won't engage with inappropriate content. If students try to misuse it, they'll simply get a refusal response‚Äîwhich itself becomes a learning moment about AI safety guardrails.</p>

                <h3>"What if my school blocks Claude.ai?"</h3>
                <p>Work with your IT department <strong>before the course starts</strong> to whitelist claude.ai. Explain this is an educational AI literacy course, not recreational AI use.</p>

                <h2>Pacing and Flexibility</h2>

                <h3>Recommended Weekly Pattern</h3>
                <p>Sample weekly schedule for daily 50-minute periods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Lesson Day (new content introduction)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Lab Day (hands-on experimentation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Discussion Day (analysis and reflection)</li>
                    <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Lesson Day or Lab Day (depending on chapter)</li>
                    <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Project Day, Discussion Day, or Assessment (varies by chapter)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Chapter Length Variability</h3>
                <p>Chapters vary in length (7-13 lessons) based on content complexity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shorter chapters</strong> (1, 7): Foundational or application-focused</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer chapters</strong> (2, 3, 6): Conceptually dense with extended practice</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>"Flex Days"</h3>
                <p>Some chapters include explicit flex days for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catching up struggling students</li>
                    <li>Deepening learning for advanced students</li>
                    <li>Addressing unexpected school closures</li>
                    <li>Revisiting concepts before assessments</li>
                    <li>Additional project work time</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>If you lose instructional time:</strong> Prioritize lab days (hands-on learning is irreplaceable). Combine related discussion days. Assign lesson day content as independent reading. Extend chapter slightly rather than rushing.
